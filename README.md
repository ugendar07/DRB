# DRB

## Overview

The Distributed Randomness Beacon is a smart contract-based solution for generating random numbers on the blockchain. Users can provide inputs to the smart contract, and the beacon will use these inputs to produce a verifiable and unbiased random number.

## Features


- **DRB Smart Contract:** The core functionality of the project is to implemente a smart contract. Users can input their data, and the smart contract will generate a random number based on this data.

- **Verifiable Randomness:** The generated random number is verifiable by users, ensuring transparency and fairness.


## Getting Started



### Prerequisites


- [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
